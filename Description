I've created a Python based Voice assistant, which uses Google Speech-Recognition to do tasks programmed.

It is a console based application and reqires some modules to run.

Libraries used :-
1. pyttsx3
2. SpeechRecognition
3. Wikipedia

It can do tasks such as :-
1. Searching on Wikipedia
2. Open Google
3. Open Youtube
4. Open Stackoverflow
5. Open your IDE installed on your desktop
6. Play random song from your device's playlist
7. Tell time
8. Send email
